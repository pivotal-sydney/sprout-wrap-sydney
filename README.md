[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal-sydney/sprout-wrap-sydney.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal-sydney/sprout-wrap-sydney)

This project uses [soloist](https://github.com/mkocher/soloist) and [librarian-chef](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef)
to run a subset of the recipes in sprout's cookbooks.

If you've never used Chef before - we highly recommend you buy &amp; watch [this excellent 17 minute screencast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/339-chef-solo-basics) by Ryan Bates.
